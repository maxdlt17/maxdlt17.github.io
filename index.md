# Hello World!

This is my home page! My name is Max Delatorre and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

Lab 2

Lab 2, part 1 was definitely one of my favorite labs. This lab was a fresh start into the world of coding. I learned how to work my way around the GitHub webpage and I learned most of the basic programs that I would be using throughout the entire process of coding and uploading my work.

Lab 10

Lab 10, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs because I always had a curiosity for how computers were able to algebraically create images. Working through this lab, I learned how a computer creates an image when a program is given to it. I was able to test the different combinations of code that would in turn create a shade of color. This is just the basics, but mastering this skill I completely see how computers make complex images with something so basic and simple.

Lab 12
	
Lab 12, part by far, is my favorite of all of them. I thoroughly enjoy watching animations, but never understood how they were created. This lab showed me the basics of how an animation is created. When I began the code, and following the instructions, I learned how color animation works. I was able to create a program that cycled through different shades of color which gave me an introduction of how animations work in the first place.
